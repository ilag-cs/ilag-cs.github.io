      Our research designs new reinforcement learning algorithms can effectively learn and build a knowledge base to reliably solve complex decision-making tasks.
      Through this work, we aim to develop a deeper computational understanding of intelligence.
      <!-- A deeper understanding of intelligence is essential for responsibly shaping the future of AI technologies and their impact on society.
      The goal of this group's research is to push the boundaries of our algorithmic understanding of intelligence. 
      To serve this goal, our work focusses on how to design learning algorithms that can effectively learn and build a knowledge base to reliably solve complex decision-making tasks.
      Most of our work uses the reinforcement learning paradigm. -->
