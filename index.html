      The computational principles underlying artificial and biological intelligence are still not well understood. 
      The goal of this group's research is to push the boundaries of our algorithmic understanding of intelligence. 
      To serve this goal, our work focusses on how intelligent systems can effectively learn and build a knowledge base to reliably solve complex decision-making tasks.
